## What was our motivation? and why did you build this project?

This Project is a coding test that I've received from FreeNow.
Also according to my interest to develop a new project that implemented the Google Maps in this, I've decided to write it.




## What did I learn?

I have learned more about Clean Architecture, Google Maps, and providing proper documents for my codes.




## What makes your project stand out?

In my opinion, this project furthermore testing and, a new experience of some technologies that I didn't have, was the best practice for implementation for me.





## Let's review this application in a vision:
## I've consumed of these libraries & technologies here:
 
 #### [1- Clean Architecture](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture)

 #### [2- Kotlin language](https://developer.android.com/kotlin)
 
 #### [3- Dependency Injection with Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android)
 
 #### [4- Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/start)
 
 #### [5- Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit)
 
 #### [6- OkHttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp)
 
 #### [7- Gson](https://github.com/google/gson)
 
 #### [8- Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines)
  
 #### [9- Junit](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/local-tests) 
  
 #### [10- Navigation Component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation)
 
 
 


Considering the common architectural principles, each application should have at least two layers:

The `UI` layer that displays application data on the screen.
The `data` layer that contains the business logic of your app and exposes application data.
Also, We can add an additional layer called the `domain` layer to simplify and reuse the interactions between the UI and data layers.
Furthermore these principles, I've added the `common` module contains everything we need to get shared between the other modules.
